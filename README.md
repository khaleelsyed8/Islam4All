## APIs Used

- **Quran Data**: We use the [Al-Quran Cloud API](https://alquran.cloud/api) to fetch Quranic data. 📜🔍
- **Hadith Data**: For Hadiths, we rely on the [Hadith API by Fawaz Ahmed](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/hadith-api). 📖✨

## How Does It Work?

Our application fetches data using these APIs to provide you with an enriched experience of both the Quran and Hadith. It’s all built with simplicity and accessibility in mind.

## Special Thanks

We couldn’t have done this without the amazing support from the API providers. Please check them out and support their work, as their help has been invaluable to this project. 🙏❤️

Jazakallahu Khair!!
